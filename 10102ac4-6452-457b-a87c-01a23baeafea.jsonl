For example, can a Unit be both Moveable and Aggressive simultaneously?\n\n**Event System Integration**: How will the Actor event production integrate with your existing `event_processor`? Will Actors emit events through the same InputEvents system?\n\n**Collision vs Overlap**: You mentioned StaticObjects can be \"solid\" - will this override the default OVERLAP behavior for collision detection?\n\n**Player/Turn Management**: Where will current player state and turn order be managed? In the Grid, or a separate game state manager?\n\n**Save/Load**: Since Actor can handle save/load but can't be on Grid, will you have a separate ActorManager for non-spatial game state?\n\nThe design looks great for a turn-based RPG!

And state manager put it into event_bus in an order of appearing. I want to remove this dependency on Controls and want controls come with behaviours. So, only Player behaviour allows listen to the input. Collision vs Overlap: we can set any collission response for CoordinateHolder(Actor) and all the inheritors, for overlap that was just an example of cursor that doesn't block anyone but it is convenient to have overlap for reacting to hovering the player for instance. Player/Turn Management: separate game state manager located somewhere in app/engine. Save/Load not ready to answer this now. I'm going to hardcode it somewhere in app/application maybe. But in theory also with behaviours. Ah, and one important note.

For example, if someone tries to add `Aggressive` to a `CoordinateHolder`, should it throw an error or silently ignore?\n\n**Player Behavior Switching**: In turn-based games, control often switches between units. Will the `Player` behavior be dynamically added/removed from units, or will you have a separate \"active unit\" concept?\n\n**Event Flow**: So the new flow would be:\n```\nInput → Player Behavior → Actor Events → Event Bus → State Manager\n```\ninstead of the current Controls-based system?\n\n**Behavior Dependencies**: Some behaviors might depend on others (e.g., `Aggressive` might require `Moveable` for positioning). Will you handle behavior dependencies?\n\n**Grid Integration**: Will the refactored Grid in `app/engine/grid.py` handle the collision response logic, or will that be in the objects themselves?\n\nThe architecture is shaping up really well - the behavior system with proper constraints will make the game very modular and extensible!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":23620,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":12,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CPuaZN63RKXFiVb6wYB9J","type":"assistant","uuid":"ee28800f-095d-4a94-8676-947336e8b169","timestamp":"2025-06-07T21:35:10.946Z"}

Player Behavior Switching: my first idea was adding/removing the behaviour, however current player is also good concept. Let combine it, for example we have player1 and player2 with different controls. And we introduce property active to Actor, this property ignores all the events produced by Actor. So we can switch between player1 and player2 with active. As for player1's party that controlled with same input let it also be active/not active. I don't know, maybe it's not convenient making sure that only one player in faction is active, but let's try or propose somth. Event Flow: Yes, behaviours offers actions app/object/behaviours/moveable.py is not working example but that is idea. Gameplay engine will some actors to active according to logic and ask player to control it (if objects possessed by player) or some AI (under AI I mean algorithmic implementation of NPCs doing actions). Control flow is the next: application got slice of all the keyboard events events = self.event_dispatcher.slice_flat(first_timestamp, render_threshold) and pass it to state manager. State manager as it has connected events and certain actions (type: Callable, so state manager but the actions to even bus. self.event_bus.post(actor, behavioursManager.get_action(key)) And it is important to not lose this connection between an actor and behaviour, so every time behaviour is adding or removing, we have to register/unregister it in state manager. For computer controlled actors we don't need input, computer just has to \"know\" the actions from behaviours to pass it via state manager to event bus. And nobody waits, if NPC and player active at the same time, both of them are could perform some actions (like in BG3). So yes, it's not always turn-based. Because of that, events manager doesn't block anyone and we have 60 fps. Behavior Dependencies: I'd better keep them independent, e.g. aggressive could fight and defend at the place when it is located if it is not moveable. Grid Integration: event bus does the next thing: tries to execute the action on coordinateHolder1, as result executed action returns some diff of properties to update of coordinateHolder1. If it on the same place, that fine, we apply the diff on coordinateHolder1. If not, then event-bus tries to move it with Grid methods, if new Cell is occupied, there must be some kind of conflict resolver that resolves the sittuation based on weights, heights etc. Conflict resolver that came to my mind could be the next: current action of coordinateHolder1 we put back to the event-bus queue (to the end, so it will be processed the next), and also we put to the end the new action that every CoordinateHolder has. As the cell is occupied by an coordinateHolder2 Something like \"pushed by CoordinateHolder(coordinateHolder1)\". This action is implemented by some base behaviour that applies to all the CoordinateHolder's and it decides if we have to stay on the place or try to move to the next cell. Based on weight and maybe some more parameters. After executing of \"pushed by CoordinateHolder(coordinateHolder1)\" the coordinateHolder2 became immobile and when event-bus tries to move the second time, conflict resolves by collision matrix only.

You get both turn-based control when needed and real-time when appropriate.\n\n**Behavior-Action Connection**: Having behaviors provide actions that get registered with the state manager is clean and maintains the connection properly.\n\n**Non-Blocking Event System**: 60fps with simultaneous actions like BG3 is ambitious but the event bus approach should handle it well.\n\n**Conflict Resolution**: The \"pushed by\" action system is clever - it gives displaced objects a chance to react rather than just blocking movement.\n\n## Implementation Questions\n\n**Active State Management**: Who determines which actors become active and when? Will this be in the game state manager, or will behaviors themselves have logic for activation timing?\n\n**Behavior Registration**: When you say \"register/unregister behavior in state manager\" - will this be automatic when behaviors are added/removed from actors, or manual calls?\n\n**Collision Matrix**: You mentioned conflict resolves by \"collision matrix only\" on the second attempt. Will this be a lookup table defining how different object types interact (e.g., Unit vs StaticObject vs CoordinateHolder)?\n\n**Action Prioritization**: In the event bus queue, if multiple actors try to move to the same cell simultaneously, how do you determine processing order? First-come-first-served, or priority based on actor properties?\n\n**Performance**: With 60fps and potentially many actors with behaviors, have you considered how to optimize the event processing?

I should acknowledge the good design decisions and maybe ask about a few implementation details that could help with the refactoring process.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":25740,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":5,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CPuiX76mUpGcD9r5xK6Nj","type":"assistant","uuid":"76983b1f-ea9b-48ab-915a-41cb3b2e6f8b","timestamp":"2025-06-07T23:19:33.058Z"}
