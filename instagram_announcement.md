**[Fantasy music begins, gameplay footage starts]**

**Have you ever dreamed** of building NPCs that actually *learn*?

**Have you ever dreamed** of AI that doesn't just follow scripts... but develops its own strategies?

**Have you ever dreamed** of creating game worlds where artificial minds grow smarter with every battle?

*[Pause as music swells, showing tactical movement on screen]*

**I'm building that dream.**

4000 lines of pure architectural poetry. A tactical game engine designed from the ground up for **Reinforcement Learning**.

*[Show message-passing between units, complex behaviors]*

This isn't just another indie game. This is an **AI laboratory** disguised as a fantasy world.

**Multi-agent communication systems.** Units that send messages, negotiate, and learn from each other.

**Behavior composition architecture.** NPCs that stack abilities like building blocks.

**Training data collection.** Every game session becomes a dataset for machine learning.

*[Show grid-based tactical combat, unit animations]*

Right now? I'm crafting the tile-map foundation - the Lego bricks for infinite procedural worlds.

**Next?** Neural networks that learn to fight, cooperate, and surprise even me.

*[Music reaches crescendo]*

**This is where gaming meets artificial intelligence.**

**This is where tactical RPGs evolve into something... intelligent.**

**Fellow developers, AI enthusiasts, dreamers of digital minds...**

**Are you ready to teach machines to think like tacticians?**

*[Final shot of units in formation, music fades]*

**Join the revolution. Link in bio.**
